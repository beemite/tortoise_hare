The quick, flashy, bragidocious Hare has challenged you to a race. You are the Tortoise; humble, reliable and slow.

Who will win? Every one is betting, 'Not you.'
Can you find the path to virctory... 
or will you be left in the dustbin of history?
-----------------------------------------

This program will be an ultra simplistic racing game against a programed opponent. Initially the race will be portrayed with simple ASCII characters and two growing lines to represent the racers' progress.

The Hare is capable of great bursts of speed, but if he goes too fast for too long he has to sleep.

The Tortoise has a steady reliable speed and requires little rest.

Both opponents need food or they will tire out quickly.
